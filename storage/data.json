Based on advice by astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria, the Julian calendar included one leap day every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long. In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days. So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter. By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the Julian calendar year would drift much less. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400. This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in wide use today. Of course, tidal friction in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century. That means that leap days like today will not be necessary ... about 4 million years from now.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2002/CaesarCoin_Wikipedia_960.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"Julius Caesar and Leap Days","copyright":"public_domain","id":54},{"copyright":"Brendan Gully","date":"2020-02-28","explanation":"At sunset on December 6 a Rocket Lab Electron rocket was launched from a rotating planet.

The background galaxies are hundreds of millions of light-years or more beyond NGC 602.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/ngc602_ChandraHubbleSpitzer_3600.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"NGC 602 and Beyond","copyright":"public_domain","id":10},{"copyright":"Clear Skies","date":"2020-01-10","explanation":"Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color filled this mountain and skyscape near Tanndalen, Sweden on January 3. Known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. This northern winter season they have been making unforgettable appearances at high latitudes, though. A type of polar stratospheric cloud, they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers the clouds can diffract sunlight after sunset and before the dawn.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/NacreousPMHeden.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"Nacreous Clouds over Sweden","id":9},{"copyright":"Ian Griffin","date":"2020-01-09","explanation":"Perihelion for 2020, the point in Earth's elliptical orbit when it is closest to the Sun, occurred on January 5th. The distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons, though. Those are governed by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation, so January is still winter in the north and summer in southern hemisphere. But it does mean that on January 5 the Sun was at its largest apparent size. This composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun, both taken from planet Earth with the same telescope and camera. The left half was captured on the date of the 2020 perihelion. The right was recorded only a week before the July 4 date of the 2019 aphelion, the farthest point in Earth's orbit. Otherwise difficult to notice, the change in the Sun's apparent diameter between perihelion and aphelion amounts to a little over 3 percent. The 2020 perihelion and the preceding 2019 aphelion correspond to the closest and farthest perihelion and aphelion of the 21st century.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/peri-api-sun.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"Perihelion to Aphelion","id":8},{"copyright":"Star Shadows Remote\nObservatory","date":"2020-01-08","explanation":"Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. Even our own galaxy engages in a sort of galactic cannibalism, absorbing small galaxies that are too close and are captured by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the practice is common in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation Eridanus, The River. Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531 (right of center), a struggle the smaller galaxy will eventually lose. Seen edge-on, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. Nicely detailed in this sharp image, the NGC 1532/1531 pair is thought to be similar to the well-studied system of face-on spiral and small companion known as M51.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/NGC1532-final3_4096r.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"Galaxies in the River","id":7},{"copyright":"Eric Coles","date":"2020-01-07","explanation":"Rippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name.  The orange and purple colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes.  The bright star AE Aurigae, visible toward the image left, is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas.  When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted (depicted here in orange). The purple region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively.  Pictured here in the Hubble color palette, the Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as IC 405, lies about 1500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/IC405hp_ColesHelm_3447.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"IC 405: The Flaming Star Nebula","id":6},{"date":"2020-01-06","explanation":"Some cloud patterns on Jupiter are quite complex. The featured tumultuous clouds were captured in May by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft currently orbiting our Solar System's largest planet.  The image was taken when Juno was only about 15,000 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops, so close that less than half of the giant planet is visible.  The rough white clouds on the far right are high altitude clouds known as pop-up clouds.  Juno's mission, now extended into 2021, is to study Jupiter in new ways. Among many other things, Juno has been measuring Jupiter's gravitational field, finding surprising evidence that Jupiter may be mostly a liquid.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/JupiterClouds_JunoGill_2295.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"Tumultuous Clouds of Jupiter","copyright":"public_domain","id":5},{"date":"2020-01-05","explanation":"On some nights, the sky is the best show in town. On this night, the sky was not only the best show in town, but a composite image of the sky won an international competition for landscape astrophotography. The featured winning image was taken in 2011 over J�kuls�rl�n, the largest glacial lake in Iceland.  The photographer combined six exposures to capture not only two green auroral rings, but their reflections off the serene lake. Visible in the distant background sky is the band of our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy. A powerful coronal mass ejection from the Sun caused auroras to be seen as far south as Wisconsin, USA.  As the Sun progresses away from its current low in surface activity toward a solar maximum a few years away, many more spectacular images of aurora are expected.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/aurora_vetter_2000.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"A Starry Night of Iceland","copyright":"public_domain","id":4},{"date":"2020-01-04","explanation":"Like salsa verde on your favorite burrito, a green aurora slathers up the sky in this 2017 June 25 snapshot from the International Space Station.

Aurorae have the signature colors of excited molecules and atoms at the low densities found at extreme altitudes. Emission from atomic oxygen dominates this view.

In this night skyscape the Hunter's stars rise in the northern hemisphere's winter sky on December 30, 2019, tangled in bare trees near Newnan, Georgia, USA. Red supergiant star Betelgeuse stands out in yellowish hues at Orion's shoulder left of center, but it no longer so strongly rivals the blue supergiant star Rigel at the Hunter's foot. In fact, skygazers around planet Earth can see a strikingly fainter Betelgeuse now, its brightness fading by more than half in the final months of 2019. Betelgeuse has long been known to be a variable star, changing its brightness in multiple cycles with approximate short and long term periods of hundreds of days to many years. The star is now close to its faintest since photometric measurements in 1926/27, likely due in part to a near coincidence in the minimum of short and long term cycles. Betelgeuse is also recognized as a nearby red supergiant star that will end its life in a core collapse supernova explosion sometime in the next 100,000 years, though that cosmic cataclysm will take place a safe 700 light-years or so from our fair planet.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/OrionTrees123019Westlake.jpg","media_type":"image","title":"The Fainting of Betelgeuse","id":1},{"date":"2020-01-01","explanation":"Why is Betelgeuse fading?  No one knows.  Betelgeuse, one of the brightest and most recognized stars in the night sky, is only half as bright as it used to be only five months ago.  Such variability is likely just  normal behavior for this famously variable supergiant, but the recent dimming has rekindled discussion on how long it may be before Betelgeuse does go supernova.  Known for its red color, Betelgeuse is one of the few stars to be resolved by modern telescopes, although only barely.  The featured artist's illustration imagines how Betelgeuse might look up close. Betelgeuse is thought to have a complex and tumultuous surface that frequently throws impressive flares.  Were it to replace the Sun (not recommended), its surface would extend out near the orbit of Jupiter, while gas plumes would bubble out past Neptune.  Since Betelgeuse is about 700 light years away, its eventual supernova will not endanger life on Earth even though its brightness may rival that of a full Moon.  Astronomers -- both amateur and professional -- will surely continue to monitor Betelgeuse as this new decade unfolds.
